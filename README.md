# 👋 Hi, I'm Bryan

🎯 Transitioning into cybersecurity after 25+ years in law enforcement, legal investigations, and military intelligence (CEWI).   
💡 Real-world experience in major crimes investigations, covert technical surveillance, legal processes, high-profile court security and high-stakes decision-making.  
🔧 My roots in computers and technology began in the 1980s. I've built databases, worked with electronics, and understand how systems *actually* work.  
📚 Currently completing a cybersecurity degree and documenting my projects here.

## Quick Tour
- I build clean data pipes and clear reports.
- I use T-SQL, R, Quarto, and Excel. I keep logic in SQL.
- I apply probability, statistics, and systems thinking.
- I use AI to learn fast and write better docs. I validate by hand.
- Ask me about: reproducible reporting, tidy exports, one-pager layouts.

## Representative Work
- **Operational_Reporting_From_TSQL** – Report layer with R and Quarto. Public-safe case study.
- **SQL_Data_Modeling_and_Query_Set** – T-SQL query set. Standardized outputs.
- **AI_Study_Buddy** – Prompts and patterns that reduced iteration time.

## Learning and Applying
- Probability and statistics: CIs, run charts, simple forecasts.
- Systems thinking: feedback loops, leverage points, delays.
- Data practice: tidy exports, parameterized windows, clear definitions.

## Invite
If you build teams that value clear methods and steady improvement, let’s talk.
