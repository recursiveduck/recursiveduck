# 👋 Hi, I'm Bryan

🎯 Transitioning into cybersecurity after 25+ years in law enforcement, legal investigations, and military intelligence (CEWI).   
💡 Real-world experience in major crimes investigations, covert technical surveillance, legal processes, high-profile court security and high-stakes decision-making.  
🔧 My roots in computers and technology began in the 1980s. I've built databases, worked with electronics, and understand how systems *actually* work.  
📚 Currently completing a cybersecurity degree and documenting my projects here.

## 🔐 Projects in Progress
- Learning how to make AI an efficient study buddy using DSPy and coding framewarks to write efficient prompts and validate responses.
- Database project tracking individual entry, participation, and program outcomes.

📬 Let's connect if you're building cyber teams and tools with integrity, purpose, and people in mind.
