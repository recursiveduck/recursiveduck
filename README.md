# 👋 Hi, I'm Bryan

🎯 Transitioning into cybersecurity after 25+ years in law enforcement, military intelligence (CEWI), and legal investigations.   
💡 Real-world experience in major crimes investigations, covert technical surveillance, courtroom processes, and high-stakes decision-making.  
🔧 Early computing roots — built databases, worked with electronics, and understand how systems *actually* work.  
📚 Currently completing a cybersecurity degree and documenting my projects here.

## 🔐 Projects in Progress
- COMING SOON!

📬 Let's connect if you're building cyber tools with integrity, purpose, and people in mind.
